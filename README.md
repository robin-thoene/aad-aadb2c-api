# aad-aadb2c-api

## About

Sample project to test how to implement a dotnet core web api that supports AAD and B2C tokens at the same time.

## Getting started

To start this app locally and test it your first need:

- an azure ad b2c app registration
- an azure ad app registration
- a sign in and sign up flow in the b2c

Then you need to enter the data taken from the aad and the b2c into the corresponding appsettings.json files.
